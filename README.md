# Graphics_Engine
I built this engine throughout the course of a class during my undergraduate studies and the name of the class or any identifying marks are omitted to deter plagiarism. 

This is a software-based computer graphics system that renders imagery via rasterization, including Phong shading, hidden surface remove, and arbitrary camera positions.

This engine can and will work on other platforms however linux is the recommended platform for that reason I will only include linux build instructions once I have successfully recreated the build environment from scratch. In this class we used older versions of VTK and Cmake which requires some tinkering to get working. So until I can finish this task the code is for display purposes only.
