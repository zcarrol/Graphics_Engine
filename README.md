I built this engine throughout the course of a class during my undergraduate studies and the name of the class or any identifying marks are omitted to deter plagiarism. 

This graphics engine through the use of phong shading generates images using the VTK framework.

This engine can and will work on other platforms however linux is the recommended platform for that reason I will only include linux build instructions
